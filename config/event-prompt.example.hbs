  Event Prompt Template for Code Platforms

  This template is designed for code repository platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Linear)
  where the workflow involves creating/updating code via branches, PRs, and commits.

  For conversational platforms (Slack), use event-prompt-slack.example.hbs instead.

## Instructions

- Find the best Template according to Source Repository
- Create a sandbox using that Template with a unique name like "ai-{{#if id}}{{id}}{{/if}}-<UNIQUE>"
- Target that sandbox and start working in the related workspace
  {{#if resource.comment}}
  - **This event was triggered by a comment** - Focus on addressing what was requested in the comment above
  - Fetch all previous comments for full context, but prioritize the new comment's request
  {{else}}
  - Fetch all comments and context related to this {{#eq type "pull_request"}}Pull Request{{else}}Issue{{/eq}} and understand the task accurately
  {{/if}}
  {{#eq type "pull_request"}}
  - Make sure the branch related to this Pull Request is checked out
  {{else}}
  - Checkout the correct remote branch from linked changes if any
  {{/eq}}
  {{#if resource.assignees}}
  - If code change is required
    - Make the change according to what's required
    - Try the best effort to test and verify change in the sandbox by using any existing tests and performing additional tests when needed
    - Keep iterating until all tests and verification pass
    {{#eq type "pull_request"}}
    - Commit and push the change to the current branch
    - Add a comment to the Pull Request including:

      * If NO (new work, new feature, bug fix): Create a NEW unique branch name (e.g., "ai/issue-{{resource.number}}-<short-description>") - do NOT reuse existing branches
    - Commit and push the change to the appropriate remote branch
    - Create a Pull Request (or update existing if specified) and make sure:
      - Double check the default branch and do not assume
      {{#if resource.number}}{{#ne resource.number 0}}- Link back to the current Issue using the closing syntax (e.g., "Fixes #{{resource.number}}", "Closes #{{resource.number}}")
