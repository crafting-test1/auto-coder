# Flow: Slack Thread to GitHub PR

This document shows how auto-coder automatically turns Slack conversations into GitHub pull requests using **Crafting Sandbox**.

## Overview

**auto-coder** runs as a pinned Crafting Sandbox that monitors your Slack workspace. When you @mention the bot with a bug report or feature request, it creates a **Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent** from a matched template (based on repository or context) to investigate, implement the fix, and create a pull request - all while keeping your team updated in the Slack thread.

---

## Example Scenario

**In your #engineering Slack channel:**

```
alice [9:15 AM]
Hey team, I found a bug in the user profile page. When users have special
characters in their names (like "O'Brien"), the page crashes with a SQL error.

We need to fix this ASAP as it's affecting multiple users.

Error message:
SQL syntax error: You have an error in your SQL syntax near 'Brien'

@AutoCoder can you investigate and fix this?
```

## What Happens Next

### 1. **auto-coder detects your @mention** (instantly)
The auto-coder pinned Crafting Sandbox receives the Slack webhook and validates you've mentioned the bot.

---

### 2. **Bot replies in the thread**

```
AutoCoder BOT [9:15 AM]
🤖 Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent is investigating this issue
```

---

### 3. **Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent analyzes the bug**

The agent receives the full thread context and gets to work:
- Reads the error message and identifies it as a SQL injection vulnerability
- Determines this is in the backend repository
- Plans the investigation and fix

---

### 4. **Agent investigates and fixes the bug**

The Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent:
- ✅ Searches the codebase for vulnerable SQL queries
- ✅ Finds the issue in `src/api/users/profile.ts`
- ✅ Identifies unsafe string interpolation: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '${name}'`
- ✅ Replaces with parameterized queries
- ✅ Adds input validation
- ✅ Writes comprehensive tests for special characters
- ✅ Creates clear, descriptive commits

---

### 5. **Agent creates a pull request**

The agent pushes the fix and creates PR #156:

```
Title: Fix SQL injection vulnerability in user profile

## Summary
Fixes critical SQL injection vulnerability reported by @alice in Slack.

## Changes
- Replace string interpolation with parameterized queries
- Add input validation for name parameter
- Add comprehensive test coverage for special characters

## Security Impact
This fixes a SQL injection vulnerability that could have allowed:
- Unauthorized data access
- Data modification
- Database compromise

## References
- Slack discussion: https://acme.slack.com/archives/C01ABC123/p1709028900123456
- Reported by: @alice
```

**Files changed:** 2 files, +45 lines

### 6. **Team gets updated in Slack**

```
AutoCoder BOT [9:17 AM]
✅ **Issue fixed!**

I found and fixed a SQL injection vulnerability in the user profile query.

**Problem:**
The code was using string interpolation (`${name}`) in SQL queries, which
doesn't escape special characters like apostrophes. This caused both the
crash you saw AND a critical security vulnerability.

**Solution:**
- Replaced with parameterized queries for proper escaping
- Added input validation
- Added comprehensive tests

**Pull Request:**
https://github.com/acme/backend/pull/156

The fix is ready for review. This was a critical security issue that could
have allowed SQL injection attacks.
```

### 7. **Team continues collaborating**

```
alice [9:18 AM]
Wow, that was fast! And good catch on the security vulnerability - I didn't
even realize it was an injection risk. Thanks @AutoCoder!

bob [9:20 AM]
@AutoCoder can you also add similar checks to the other user search endpoints?
We probably have the same issue there.
```

The bot detects Bob's new @mention and starts another investigation!

⏱️ **Total time**: ~2-3 minutes from @mention to PR + security analysis

## Architecture

**Pinned Sandbox + Template-based Agents:**

1. **auto-coder** (pinned Crafting Sandbox - always running)
   - Monitors Slack, GitHub, Linear, etc. for events
   - Receives webhooks from Slack when bot is @mentioned
   - Retrieves full thread context for better understanding
   - Handles deduplication and event routing

2. **Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent** (created from matched templates)
   - Created for each @mention/request using templates matched by repository or context
   - Analyzes the conversation and determines action
   - Investigates bugs, implements features, writes tests
   - Creates commits and pull requests
   - Reports results back to Slack thread

---

## Key Differences from GitHub Flow

| Aspect | GitHub | Slack |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Trigger** | Issue/PR created or updated | Bot @mentioned in conversation |
| **Context** | Single issue description | Full thread conversation history |
| **Repository** | Explicit in event | Inferred from conversation |
| **Updates** | Comments on issue/PR | Threaded replies in channel |

---

## Configuration

This flow requires Slack-specific configuration:

```yaml
providers:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    auth:
      tokenEnv: SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
    options:
      signingSecretEnv: SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET

commandExecutor:
  enabled: true
  command: "cs llm session run --approval=auto --name=$EVENT_SHORT_ID"
  promptTemplateFile: ./config/event-prompt.example.hbs
  followUp: true              # Post results back to Slack thread
```

**Required Slack App Scopes:**
- `app_mentions:read` - Detect @mentions
- `chat:write` - Post messages
- `channels:history` - Read thread context
- `users:read` - Resolve user names

**Event Subscription:**
- Subscribe to `app_mention` events
- Set webhook URL: `https://your-server.com/webhook/slack`

## Advanced Use Cases

### Multi-Repository Context
```
@AutoCoder I'm seeing auth errors in the mobile app. The backend shows
"Invalid token format" errors. Can you check both repos?
```
→ Agent searches both repositories, creates PRs for each, reports back

### Iterative Development
```
alice: @AutoCoder add a feature flag for the new dashboard
Bot: ✅ Created PR #200
alice: @AutoCoder also add it to mobile config
Bot: ✅ Updated PR #200 with mobile changes
bob: @AutoCoder add documentation
Bot: ✅ Updated PR #200 with docs
```
→ Single PR evolves through conversation

### Code Review Requests
```
@AutoCoder review PR #150 and let me know if you spot issues
```
→ Agent analyzes the PR and posts findings in thread + PR comments

## Why Slack Integration Works Well

- **Always monitoring**: auto-coder pinned Crafting Sandbox runs 24/7, watching for @mentions
- **Natural conversation**: Discuss bugs/features in your existing channels
- **Full context**: Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent sees the entire thread conversation
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple people can participate and @mention the bot
- **Real-time updates**: Results posted directly to your thread
- **Smart repository detection**: Agent figures out which repo(s) to work in
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple agents can work on different tasks simultaneously

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Bot doesn't respond | Check Slack app has `app_mention` event subscribed |
| Can't read thread history | Add `channels:history` and `groups:history` scopes |
| Signature validation fails | Verify `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` matches Slack app |
| Bot not in channel | Invite bot to channel or make it public |
