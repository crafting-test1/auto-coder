# Flow: GitHub Issue to GitHub PR

This document shows how auto-coder automatically turns GitHub issues into pull requests using **Crafting Sandbox**.

## Overview

**auto-coder** runs as a pinned Crafting Sandbox that monitors your GitHub repositories. When you create a GitHub issue, it detects the event and creates a **Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent** from a matched template (based on repository or context) to implement the feature or fix, then creates a pull request with the changes - all automatically.

---

## Example Scenario

**You create a GitHub issue:**

```
Title: Add dark mode toggle to settings page

Users have been requesting a dark mode option. We should add a toggle
switch to the settings page that allows users to switch between light
and dark themes. The preference should be persisted in localStorage.

Acceptance criteria:
- Toggle switch in Settings component
- Persist theme preference
- Apply theme globally
```

## What Happens Next

### 1. **auto-coder detects the issue** (within seconds)
The auto-coder pinned Crafting Sandbox receives the GitHub webhook and validates it's a new issue that needs work.

---

### 2. **Bot posts a status comment**

On your issue, you'll see:
```
🤖 Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent is working on this issue
```

This lets you know the agent has started working, and prevents duplicate processing.

---

### 3. **Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent analyzes your request**

The agent receives a prompt with your issue details and gets to work:
- Reads and understands your requirements
- Explores your codebase to understand the architecture
- Plans the implementation approach

---

### 4. **Agent implements the feature**

The Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent:
- ✅ Finds the relevant files (`Settings.tsx`, `ThemeContext.tsx`)
- ✅ Adds a dark mode toggle component
- ✅ Implements localStorage persistence
- ✅ Applies theme globally via context
- ✅ Adds CSS styles for dark mode
- ✅ Writes comprehensive tests
- ✅ Creates clean, descriptive commits

---

### 5. **Agent creates a pull request**

The agent pushes a new branch and opens PR #43:

```
Title: Add dark mode toggle to settings page

## Changes
- Added theme toggle switch in Settings component
- Theme preference persisted in localStorage
- Dark theme applied globally via ThemeContext
- Added comprehensive tests

## Testing
- [x] Toggle switches between light and dark mode
- [x] Preference persists across page reloads
- [x] Theme applied globally
- [x] Tests passing

Closes #42
```

**Files changed:** 4 files, +120 lines

---

### 6. **You receive a status update**

Back on issue #42, the bot comments:

```
✅ **Task completed!**

Created pull request: https://github.com/acme/web-app/pull/43

The dark mode toggle has been implemented with:
- Theme toggle switch in Settings component
- Preference persistence via localStorage
- Global theme application
- Comprehensive test coverage

Please review the PR!
```

### 7. **You review and merge**

The PR is ready for your review. The Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent has done all the heavy lifting - you just need to review, approve, and merge!

⏱️ **Total time**: ~2-3 minutes from issue creation to PR ready for review

## Iterative Development

### You can keep adding requirements!

**You comment on the issue:**
```
@auto-coder-bot Can you also add keyboard shortcut Ctrl+D to toggle dark mode?
```

**The Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent:**
1. Detects your new comment
2. Posts "Working on the update..."
3. Updates the existing PR with the keyboard shortcut
4. Replies: "Updated PR #43 with Ctrl+D keyboard shortcut"

### Deduplication protection

If the webhook is accidentally triggered multiple times, auto-coder is smart enough to avoid duplicate work:
- ✅ Checks the last comment on the issue
- ✅ If it's from the bot, skips processing
- ✅ Only processes when there's new human input

## Configuration

This flow requires minimal configuration in your `config/watcher.yaml`:

```yaml
providers:
  github:
    enabled: true
    auth:
      type: token
      tokenEnv: GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
    options:
      webhookSecretEnv: GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
      repositories:
        - your-org/your-repo
      events:
        - issues              # Detect new issues
        - issue_comment       # Detect follow-up comments
        - pull_request        # Detect PR updates

commandExecutor:
  enabled: true
  command: "cs llm session run --approval=auto --name=$EVENT_SHORT_ID"
  promptTemplateFile: ./config/event-prompt.example.hbs
  followUp: true              # Post result back to issue
```

## Architecture

**Pinned Sandbox + Template-based Agents:**

1. **auto-coder** (pinned Crafting Sandbox - always running)
   - Monitors GitHub, Slack, Linear, etc. for events
   - Receives webhooks and manages polling
   - Handles deduplication and event routing

2. **Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent** (created from matched templates)
   - Created for each issue/task using templates matched by repository or context
   - Reads code, implements features, writes tests
   - Creates commits and pull requests
   - Reports results back

## Why This Works

- **Real-time**: Webhooks deliver issue events within seconds
- **Smart**: Deduplication prevents processing the same issue twice
- **Autonomous**: Crafting Sandbox Coding Agent has full access to read code, make changes, and create PRs
- **Transparent**: All activity is visible as comments on your issues
- **Scalable**: Multiple coding agents can work in parallel on different tasks
- **Flexible**: Works with GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Slack, and more

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Bot doesn't respond | Check webhook configuration and bot permissions |
| Duplicate processing | Ensure deduplication is enabled with correct `botUsername` |
| No follow-up comment | Verify `followUp: true` and bot has write access |
